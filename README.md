# Film Management System (FMS)

# Development of Film Management System (FMS)

* This project was part of my training program at Capgemini. Film Management System (FMS) is an application, which helps to manage an actor details like – personal and professional info of actor. Personal info like First Name, Last Name etc. And professional info like –Films, Film Category, Film Rating etc.
FMS aims to manage complete life cycle of film viz add (create a film – where all info will be captured for the first time), edit (modify film info) – like roles, films, etc. Remove (delete film) film data from system. Along with add, edit and remove – system should display all actor summaries (View) and must support search facility.
